Reaching New Heights

Mary Jane, CEO

‘The theme for this year's growth strategy was
reaching the top of the mountain, and while we stilt
haven't quite breached the summit, there's a long way
down from where we started. This has been a year of
‘exponential growth for Small Business Company.

‘Asa quick overview, our team has grown 3x from the
beginning of last year, our site traffic has increased,
tenfold, and we have formed multiple lucrative
partnerships. The core values of Small Business
‘Company are innovation, transparency, and grt. Our
accomplishments this year reflect those core values,

We know that at the heart of success is a strong team
‘with shared goals. We set goals as a team and the
individual drive and passion of each member is what
propels us to achieve those goals.

Ihave ne doubt that next year will be just as exciting
land that the growth will be even greater.
